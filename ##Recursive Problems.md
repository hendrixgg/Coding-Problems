## % Simple Steps to solve recursive problems

1. Identify the smallest possible inputs (base cases)

2. Play around with examples and visualize

3. Relate harder cases to simpler cases

3. Generalize the pattern

4. Write code by combining the recursive pattern with the base case

## % Coming up with the recusize function

    Let f(n) be a recursive function
    
     1. show that f(1) works (base case)

     2. Assume f(n-1) works

     3. Show f(n) works using f(n-1)
